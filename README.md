This is a Web Application designed for Chinese Bible Church of Maryland and its affliates for serving Lunch to Church members.
It is built with Asp.Net Forms in 2015 by Developer: Grace Tang & Chih-Kao Liao. 
Rockville Evangelical Mission (REM) graciously got the application from CBCM and modified to use in its own church lunch service.
It is modified to not rely on www.cbcm.org website and have an independent database.
